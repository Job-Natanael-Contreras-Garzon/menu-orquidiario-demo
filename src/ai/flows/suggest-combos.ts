  Suggest enticing package/combo deals by smartly grouping existing menu items based on co-occurrence and semantic relationships.
  Offer each combo at a special, single, attractive price.

  The current menu items are:
  {{#each menuItems}}
  - {{name}} ({{category}}): {{description}} Price: {{price}}
  {{/each}}

  Suggest a few combos (3-5), with unique names, descriptions, the items included, and a special price for each combo.
  The price should be lower than the sum of the individual prices of the items.
  Be creative and consider combinations that would be appealing to customers.
  The "items" field should contain just the names of the items. Do not include the category or price in the item names.
  Remember to respect the specified output schema.
